### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**EricLudwig1/EricLudwig1** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


Iâ€™m currently using GitHub in support of IST707-Data Analytics offered through Syracuse University

Iâ€™m currently a Master's student studying Applied Data Science with a focus on business analytics. 

As the class progresses, I will update this README with classes and projects completed along with current projects

- âš¡ Fun fact: I met President Biden and my 4-month-old daughter within 5 minutes of eachother following a deployment on the USS Gettysburg (CG 64).

My other interests include chess, fantasy football, and writing. If you have any questions about fantasy football, feel free to reach out.
If you have any questions about chess, I'm not it!
